# Rules explanation (for documentation/transparency):
# 1. Mythic can ONLY occur during fusion (not genesis)
# 2. ALL conditions must be met before trigger check
# 3. Trigger uses deterministic seed modulo - fully reproducible
# 4. Override traits replace generated traits for mythic distinction
# 5. Rarity tier is automatically set to "Mythic" if triggered
